The idea behind this was to make a simple and functional rewrite of plex debrid that seemed to get a bit clustered.

Rewrite of plex_debrid project, limited functionality:
- Services include: plex, mdblist, torrentio and realdebrid
- Only movies supported for now... (torrentio.py line 25)
- Real debrid supports only cached content
